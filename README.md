# touch-strings
A musical instrument based on a violin


to allow for bowing type to change

use current sound menu item? - 


so i feel like i want to measure distance travelled in one direction at a time

so if you keep spinning in one direction there has to be an amount that is maximum velocity and then we stay there 

but if you change direction that needs to be logged

We then measure how fast that one direction was

before doing the same on the return

etc etc. 

ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK DIRECTION CHANGE

SO POLL MORE OFTEN?

IF DIRECTION CHANGE START AGAIN?
